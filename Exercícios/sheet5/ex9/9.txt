- Name two advantages of SSD over HDD:
	Faster and Safer

- Name two disadvantages of SSD over HDD:
	Higher-priced and Less data storage capacity

- Why is it that Flash NAND storage devices probably take much more time to modify a disk file than to merely append to it?
	Because the data cannot be overwritten until the whole block is erased, leading to copy the wanted data to a new 	block and perform garbage collection

- Random writes to SSD generally perform better (about twice better) than random reads. Try to find out why...
	Due to how writes are made in a SSD, the randomness of a write is not as 'random' as reads can be, as they are very 	much well controlled and pre-defined. As such, the performance of a random write should be superior to that of a 	random read since it is more controlled and way closer to the sequential counterpart.
