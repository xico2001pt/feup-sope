File naming is important for the easy retrieval and search of data. As such, it usually follows an organization point of view. For example, one can use different folders for different matters, and consequent subfolders for different topics on it, and different naming for different versions. With this, it becomes easier to find and keep the information thoroughly organized.

As databases are organized on different tables for different subjects, different columns for different attributes, and as web search pages are organized with different routes for efficient packaging, the same can be applied for the above case of file naming.
